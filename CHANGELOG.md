### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactored

#### PDF Generation System Cleanup
- **Consolidated PDF Architecture**: Removed duplicate PDF generation systems and organized into single, efficient pipeline

  - Moved `lib/pdf-generator.tsx` ‚Üí `lib/pdf/generator.tsx` for better organization
  - Created `lib/pdf/index.ts` for clean exports
  - Added `lib/pdf/README.md` with comprehensive documentation
- **Removed Unused Components**:
  - `components/pdf/pdf-generator.tsx` (unused PDFGenerator component)
  - `components/pdf/rti-document.tsx` (unused RTIDocument component)
  - `components/pdf/pdf-preview.tsx` (unused preview component)
  - `app/api/rti/pdf/route.ts` (unused API route)
  - `lib/pdf-utils.ts` (unused utilities)
- **Import Path Optimization**: Updated all imports to use clean `lib/pdf` index exports

#### Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed @tanstack/react-query**: Eliminated unused React Query dependency and all related code
- **Package Removal**: Uninstalled both `@tanstack/react-query` and `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`
- **File Deletions**: Removed `lib/queryClient.ts` (57 lines of unused configuration)
